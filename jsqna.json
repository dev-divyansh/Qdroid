    "question": "What is a callback function in JavaScript, and how is it used?",
    "answer": "A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed later when the first function has completed its operation. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous code."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'map()' method in JavaScript, and how does it work?",
    "answer": "The 'map()' method is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of an existing array. It does not mutate the original array."

    "questionNumber": "89",
    "question": "Explain the concept of 'closures' in JavaScript, and provide an example.",
    "answer": "A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its parent function even after the parent function has finished executing. Here's an example:\n\n```\nfunction outer() {\n  var x = 10;\n  function inner() {\n    console.log(x);\n  }\n  return inner;\n}\n\nvar closure = outer();\nclosure(); // Outputs 10\n```\nIn this example, 'inner' is a closure that can access the 'x' variable even though 'outer' has finished executing."

    "questionNumber": "91",
    "question": "What is the 'async/await' feature in JavaScript and its benefits?",
    "answer": "Async/await is a syntactical feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner, making it easier to reason about and maintain."
